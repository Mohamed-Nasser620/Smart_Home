# Smart Home 
C Project - Based on Atmega32 Microcontroller

-	Developed a system that simulates different features, lights controlled by an IR sensor that detects a
movement, a door that is locked/unlocked using a password provided by Bluetooth, measuring the temperature
and display it on LCD and finally an alarm system that detects wrong passwords or overheat

-	Drivers: GPIO, UART, Timer, LCD, Servomotor, LM35 sensor, IR sensor, ADC, Bluetooth module
-	Implemented on PCB
